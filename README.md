# project-4---sort-of

I am a long way back in the course, still working on my project 2 resubmission for september 3rd.
i dont know why but i have a really hard time getting to grips with it all.
i really hope i can get a chance for a resubmission of this one to, having already failed project 2 and 3 and doing my best to be able to deliver anything for them, but not feeling confident at even that. 
to my understanding if i submit nothing im done, but this is basicly all i have time to submit if i am to have any chance on the other erlier projects. 
Thank you for your patience.
